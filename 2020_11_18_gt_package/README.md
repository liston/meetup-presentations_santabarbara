### Live Coding Exercise Materials:

Copy and paste the following code into your console to install the necessary packages (if necessary) prior to our meetup:

    install.packages(“tidyverse”)
    install.packages("gt")
    
Fork our GitHub Repo or download code and data files [here](https://github.com/j-verstaen/gt_workshop_SB_R_Ladies).

If you choose to download materials rather than forking the GitHub repo, we suggest creating an R project to store the files in for ease of use. If you are unsure how to do so, you can find detailed instructions [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HAvvoKrX8Ehm_NCipkij0OqUQgWIAdCR/view?usp=sharing).
