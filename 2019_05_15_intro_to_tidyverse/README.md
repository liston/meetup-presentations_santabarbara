This session will be led by Santa Barbara R-Ladies An Bui and Sam Csik from UCSB's Ecology, Evolution & Marine Biology department!

An and Sam will teach useful functions for data tidying, wrangling and visualization using tidyverse packages & functions (e.g. dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, forcats, etc.). This session will be great for R users at any level, whether it's your first time exploring the tidyverse or if you're refreshing your wrangling skills!

**About An:** An is a second-year graduate student in EEMB advised by Holly Moeller and Hillary Young. She studies the effects of multiple anthropogenic stressors on species communities and function. She loves being asked to identify birds, knitting, and kissing dogs on the forehead.

**About Sam:** Sam is a second-year masters student in EEMB advised by Dr. Adrian Stier. Her thesis work is focused on understanding how temperature impacts spiny lobster foraging ecology and physiology. She is obsessed with her two cats, loves hiking, Boston sports, and the smell of a good campfire.
