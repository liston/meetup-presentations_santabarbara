# README

[Slides](https://rladies.github.io/meetup-presentations_santabarbara/2018_08_22_mobprogramming/mobprogramming_and_ggplot2.html#1) for the Mob Programming RLadies Meetup at NCEAS August 22, 2018. 

[Accompanying repo](https://github.com/jules32/rladies-ggplot2) for the mob programming tasks. The .Rmd has visualization tasks for the team to answer with data on visitions to US National Parks â€“ and when those questions required some data wrangling, we provided the code since the focus was ggplot2.

Debrief: 

- we had 4 groups of 5
- we had 4 experienced programmers (from NCEAS) bring their laptops that already had RStudio installed; they cloned/downloaded the accompanying repo ahead of time so that the time was not focused on GitHub or setup, just getting into ggplot as soon as possible. 
- rotated who was typing after ~8 minutes per person so that everyone had a chance to code and so we would have time to showcase at the end
- most particpants were new to R and/or ggplot2 so having the experienced programmer on the first rotation allowed them to teach-by-doing and then answer questions throughout
