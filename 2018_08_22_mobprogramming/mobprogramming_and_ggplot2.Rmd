# The Plan

---

# `ggplot2` with National Parks data

We'll be coding together with `ggplot2`, and a bit of `dplyr`

--

- `ggplot` is a graphics package specifically built to help you iteratively create customized graphs

--

- `dplyr` is a package for data wrangling; it has 5 main functions to do frequent tasks

We'll be exploring data for visits to US National Parks. 

---

# More about `ggplot2`

To make the most basic graph, you need to tell R three things:

1. You're using ggplot
1. What data is used to create the graph
1. What type of graph you want to create

â€¦everything beyond that is optional customization.

Anatomy of ggplot tidyverse reference

- data
- aesthetics

---

# More about National Parks data

---

# Helpful functions from `dplyr`

Also part of the `tidyverse`

- filter
- select
- %>%


---

# Quick demo

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

np_visit <- read_csv("data/np_visit.csv")

dino_nm <- np_visit %>% 
  filter(park_name == "Dinosaur National Monument")
  
ggplot(data = dino_nm, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

# Your turn!

1. Break into teams with diverese skill levels

1. Use one computer that has RStudio installed

1. Go to <https://github.com/jules32/rladies-ggplot2>

1. Download or clone with the green button

Then, in RStudio: 

1. Open `national_parks_analysis.Rmd`

1. Walk through the demo code

1. Answer the questions provided, or ask your own!
